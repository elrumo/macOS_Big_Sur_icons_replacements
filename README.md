## How do I change the app icon on my mac?
It's super easy! We've made sure that all icons here work with no problem. You just need to download the icon you want, find the app to update on Finder, select it and "File/Get Info" or "cmd + i and drag and drop the downloaded .icns file to the new window.

## I'd like to contribute

Here are some rules you show know:
- Don't use spaces for the icon names, instead use "_"
- When using the template, export in 1x (high res) and 0.25x (low res)
- Before uploading the the icons, add their names exactly as they have been exported to the [icons.txt](https://bit.ly/macOSicons-txt) file
- Use [this free app](http://www.img2icnsapp.com) to convert the .png to a usable .icns
- Make a Pull Request with the new icons
- If you are creating an icon for an open-source project, please consider submitting the icon to their respective repository for their use as well.

### I don't know how to make a pull request or I'm not familiar with GitHub
Not a problem! This repo can also be a great introduction to the open source community and GitHub for designers, so welcome if you're new to this!

First of all, you'll need to download the template for the icons [here](https://github.com/elrumo/macOS_Big_Sur_icons_replacements/raw/master/design/Template%20-%20Icon%20-%20App.sketch).

If you're new to GitHub, or you've never made a pull request, try following [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/).  Did you manage? Congrats! If you're still not quite sure about how to make pull requests, crate a new issue [here](https://bit.ly/macOSicons-help) and try to explain where you're stuck, and if that still doesn't work for you, simply upload the icons on a shared drive and share them with us on the newly created issue.
