to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. </li><li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. </li><li>It's possible to work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of <a href=\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\">integrations</a> to speed up your workflows, connect email lists, build communities and much more.</li></ol><h2 id=\"behind-the-scenes\">Behind the scenes</h2><p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing\">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.</p><p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost\">community</a>.</p><h2 id=\"next-up-the-editor\">Next up, the editor</h2><p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href=\"https://onionicons.com/blog/the-editor/\">the Ghost editor</a>.
