Someone hacked the database, deleted everything on it and requested I pay 0.015 Bitcoin, around $900 at the time of writing, to get everything back.</p><p>No part of the website and none of the code that runs on the backend server has been affected or compromised. The hacker <strong>did not</strong> get access to any of the servers, only the database. So you can rest assured that visiting this website is perfectly safe. However, it is only fair you should know that the database, which contained 12GB worth of icons, also had the email addresses from anyone who had submitted an icon. There was no other information saved on the database, so you are safe, but I would like to warn everyone to be extra cautious of phishing emails and spam, should the hacker use those them to reach out.</p><p>Right after I found out about the hack, I notified <a href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/what-is-action-fraud\">Action Fraud</a>, the UK‚Äôs national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime. I should hear back from them within the next 28 days.</p><h2 id=\"the-data\">The Data</h2><p>Regarding the data, I had backups and will hopefully soon be fully operational. Until then, you might find that some icons are not loading while others do, this is because I‚Äôm using Cloudflare, which has cached the most requested icons. The rest will not be available to download until the backup is restored.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, once the service is operational again, the database will be transferred to a MongoDB instance managed by DigitalOcean. The website is being hosted on Vercel and the backend, which is also where the database was and, is on a secure server provided by Fosshost, so if one goes down, the other one doesn‚Äôt.</p><h2 id=\"the-future\">The future</h2><p>As part of my future plans for this website, I am planning on letting you create your own user account so that you could manage all your data yourself. However, to avoid situations like this one, I will not be asking for email accounts or passwords; authentication will only be possible and handled by third-party services like GitHub, Twitter or Google.</p><p>I am deeply sorry this has happened, but I will not let this stop me from building the open icons platform I have envisioned. In fact, I have already designed a draft of what that could look like, and you can preview it on this <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/7Be5ANXVLuNqR7vWpiZLzC/Template-Icon-App?node-id=645%3A32&amp;viewport=621%2C1825%2C0.20304979383945465&amp;scaling=scale-down-width&amp;page-id=109%3A2&amp;hide-ui=1\">Figma Prototype</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F7Be5ANXVLuNqR7vWpiZLzC%2FTemplate-Icon-App%3Fnode-id%3D645%253A32%26viewport%3D621%252C1825%252C0.20304979383945465%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width%26page-id%3D109%253A2\" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>For any questions, concerns or feedback, you can reach out to me through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elrumo\">Twitter</a>.</p><p>Thanks again for all your support,<br>Elias</p>","comment_id":"606725acd9a035b59a3b831b","feature_image":"https://blog.macosicons.com/blog/content/images/2021/04/Ex9SwmMW8AEnA17.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"free","created_at":"2021-04-02T14:09:48.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-04-02T15:55:41.000+00:00","published_at":"2021-04-02T15:31:54.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"A hacker has deleted the database with all the icons.

But this is the thing with most ideas and side projects, one day, you're working on a bookmarking service, the next you blink, Apple announces Big Sur, and you see your side project being within the top 5 products of the day on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/1000-free-macos-big-sur-icons\">ProductHunt</a>.</p><p>When I started working on this, I didn't intend for it to become what it has become today. It's almost like it took a life of its own once it went viral with the release of macOS Big Sur; nothing I had done had changed, only now there were hundreds of thousands of new Big Sur users that wanted their dock to look pretty.</p><p>It's been a few months since the release, and something I've learnt is that there is still an unmet demand that goes beyond macOS users. Windows and Linux users have been asking for something similar to what we've created, and that is exactly what I'm aiming to build.</p><blockquote>An open platform for all things icons.</blockquote><p>I'm taking things one step a time, and I don't have a well-defined roadmap, but the following three will be my main focus for the next few weeks: - User accounts, view the status of your own submissions and make changes to them. - Support to directly upload .icns to the site. - An API to access all the icons from your own app.</p><p>As I said, everything is still up in the air, and I still have many questions I need to answer, but one thing I know is that I will try my best to make that vision happen.
